# Deep Learning Capstone Project

## Udacity - Machine Learning Nanodegree - Capstone Project

This is my capstone project for the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree. I use deep learning to recognize digits in SVHN dataset.

The Report.pdf is the main capstone report.

I use Tensorflow to train my model and all code was implemented as Jupyter Notebooks (Python 2.7), including:

* 1_Data_Preparing.ipynb

  It's about data preprocess.

* 2_Model.ipynb

  It's about model architecture, trainding and evaluating.
